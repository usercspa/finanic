**Introduction**
Due to the outbreak of covid-19, many businesses and services have switched online. Traditional banks have also adapted to the new normal and offer online and mobile banking.

Opening a bank account is becoming much easier, individuals can fill in the online form, and upload their identification documents for verification. However, not everyone has access to the internet or smart devices.

To tackle the digital divide, we are building a banking SMS chatbot to help individuals who are less tech-savvy/ without access to the internet/ smart devices to open a bank account.
